# Global header contract

![Desktop header reference](reference/header-desktop.png)

## Desktop composition

The supplied page source uses:

```text
header.tm-header.uk-visible@m
  sticky wrapper: media="@m", show-on-up, slide-top animation
  .uk-navbar-container
    .uk-container
      nav.uk-navbar
        .uk-navbar-left  -> linked logo
        .uk-navbar-right -> navigation
```

The white bar has a thin cyan top rule. The logo sits on the left, and navigation aligns right. `Home` is visibly active in the supplied screenshot; inactive entries are muted until hover/focus.

The source logo markup declares `288 × 77`, links to `https://truechristian.church/`, and uses the alt text `A True Christian Church`.

| Part | Desktop contract |
| --- | --- |
| Surface | White with `1px solid #00cadb` top rule |
| Container | `1200px` maximum width |
| Navbar | `80px` minimum height |
| Logo | `288 × 77px`, intrinsic aspect ratio |
| Navigation | Montserrat 400, `11px`, uppercase, `2px` tracking |
| Active text | `#2d2e33` |
| Inactive text | `#b4b5ba` as measured in the supplied source screenshot |
| Link spacing | Approximately `15px` inline hit-area padding on each side |
| Services icon/subtitle | `20px` world icon; `Join us` is Montserrat 400 at `12px` |

The screenshot is a 1.25× capture; its device-pixel geometry is larger than the CSS contract.

The supplied screenshot is the home page, so `Home` is active there. The reusable fragment intentionally has no hardcoded current item; the consuming page must add `aria-current="page"` and `.is-active` to its actual route.

## Canonical main-site order

1. Home
2. The Holy Scriptures
3. Sermons
4. Articles
5. Daily
6. Services — subtitle: Join us

For another True Christian Church site, the logo and `Home` remain fixed. Navigation required by that site follows `Home` using the same spacing, typography, active state, and accessible dropdown behavior.

The canonical main-site mega-menu is not a generic requirement for every satellite. Its full static labels, nesting, and URLs are preserved in `src/data/main-site-navigation.json`, and the supplied desktop markup is retained in `docs/source/header-desktop-source.html`. Date-sensitive cards inside the Articles and Daily mega-menus remain content, not theme constants.

## Mobile composition

The source uses `tm-header-mobile uk-hidden@m`, a left menu toggle, centered logo, and a slide-mode off-canvas menu. Nested entries become an accordion. Implementations on other frameworks must preserve this behavior even when class names differ.

The portable template uses `src/js/site-header.js` for open/close state, submenu state, Escape, focus containment, inert off-screen navigation, and breakpoint synchronization. Load the built script with `defer`.

## Reusable markup

Use `src/html/site-header.html` as the generic portable shell. It intentionally demonstrates the top-level/dropdown pattern without freezing the content-heavy Articles mega-menu into every site. A canonical main-site implementation must render the complete `src/data/main-site-navigation.json`; a satellite replaces the example entries after `Home` with its own links.
